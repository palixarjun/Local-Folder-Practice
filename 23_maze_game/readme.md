# Maze Game Code Explanation

This code is for creating a maze game using the Matter.js physics engine. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

## 1. Function Definition
- **`restartGame`**: This function initializes or restarts the maze game.

## 2. Import Matter.js Components
- **Destructuring**: `const { Engine, Render, Runner, World, Bodies, Body, Events } = Matter;` imports necessary components from Matter.js.

## 3. Game Configuration
- **Grid and Screen Dimensions**: Defines the grid size (20 horizontal and 10 vertical cells) and the screen dimensions.
- **Unit Lengths**: Calculates the width and height of each grid cell.

## 4. Setup Physics Engine
- **Create Engine**: Initializes the physics engine (`engine`).
- **Set Gravity**: Sets the gravity to zero initially.
- **Create Render Object**: Sets up the rendering engine with screen dimensions and options (like disabling wireframes).

## 5. Create Walls
- **Borders**: Defines static walls for the maze's outer boundaries and adds them to the world.

## 6. Maze Generation
- **Grid Initialization**: Creates arrays to track visited cells and walls.
- **Random Starting Cell**: Chooses a random starting point in the grid.
- **Recursive Function**: `stepThroughCell` generates the maze by recursively visiting neighboring cells and removing walls between them.
- **Create Walls**: Adds vertical and horizontal walls to the world based on the generated maze structure.

## 7. Create Game Elements
- **Goal**: Adds a static rectangle as the goal (winning point) in the maze.
- **Player's Ball**: Adds a dynamic circle to represent the player.

## 8. Game Controls
- **`removeInfo` Function**: Hides the information text when the game starts.
- **`keydownHandler` Function**: Updates the ball's velocity based on key presses (`W`, `A`, `S`, `D` or arrow keys). Removes previous keydown listeners and adds a new one.

## 9. Win Condition
- **Collision Detection**: Listens for collisions between the ball and the goal. When they collide, it:
  - **Enables Gravity**: Makes walls fall by changing their properties.
  - **Displays Winning Message**: Shows the winner message.

## 10. Restart Game
- **Restart Button Listener**: Resets the game when the restart button is clicked:
  - **Clear World and Engine**: Clears all objects and stops rendering.
  - **Remove Canvas**: Removes the old canvas and resets the render object.
  - **Show/Hide Text**: Updates visibility of text elements.
  - **Recursively Call `restartGame`**: Restarts the game.

## 11. Start Game
- **Initial Call**: Calls `restartGame` to start the game when the script loads.

## Summary
This code sets up a maze game where the player controls a ball with keyboard inputs to navigate through a maze. It handles the game initialization, maze generation, ball movement, win condition, and game restarting. The use of Matter.js provides physics simulation for the maze walls and the ball.

## Maze Generation Algorithm

The code uses the **Recursive Backtracking algorithm** to generate the maze. This algorithm is a common method for creating mazes, known for its simplicity and effectiveness in producing interesting maze structures. Here's how it works in the code:

### Recursive Backtracking Algorithm

1. **Initialize the Grid**: 
   - The grid is set up to track visited cells and walls.

2. **Choose a Random Starting Cell**:
   - A random starting cell is selected to begin the maze generation process.

3. **Recursive Cell Exploration**:
   - The `stepThroughCell` function is used to recursively visit neighboring cells.
   - For each cell:
     - **Mark as Visited**: The current cell is marked as visited.
     - **Shuffle Neighbors**: The neighboring cells (up, right, down, left) are shuffled to ensure randomness.
     - **Check Validity**: Each neighbor is checked to ensure it's within bounds and has not been visited.
     - **Remove Wall**: If a valid neighbor is found, the wall between the current cell and the neighbor is removed.
     - **Recursive Call**: The function is called recursively for the valid neighbor.

4. **Base Case**:
   - If a cell has been visited, the function returns without further action.

### Characteristics of the Algorithm

- **Randomness**: The algorithm's use of shuffled neighbors ensures that the maze has a random and unpredictable structure.
- **Backtracking**: By recursively visiting cells and removing walls, the algorithm backtracks when it reaches dead-ends, ensuring that all cells are eventually reachable.

This approach generates a perfect maze with a single solution, meaning there are no loops or multiple paths between any two points.
